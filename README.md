# Advent of Code 2024
## Running with Deno
Make sure to have **Deno 2** installed, then run the command below, replacing `<day>`, `<part>` and `<suffix>` with the desired values:

```bash
deno run solve <day> <part> <suffix>
```

#### Examples:
- `deno run solve 9 2 example`
  - will run _`day/09/part2.ts`_ with the _`input-example.txt`_ file.
- `deno run solve 5 1`
  - will run _`day/05/part1.ts`_ with the _`input.txt`_ file.
